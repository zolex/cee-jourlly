    coffee_type_1:
        name: Risteretto
        info: A very short, even more concentrated espresso
        ingredients: ['@ingredient_1']
        preparation: "A Ristretto is a very short and concentrated espresso shot.\n
            \n
            1. Grind: Use a very fine grind, often slightly finer than for a regular espresso.\n
            2. Dose & Tamp: Use the standard amount of finely ground coffee for an espresso shot (e.g., 7-10g for a single, 14-20g for a double). Tamp firmly and evenly.\n
            3. Extraction: Start the espresso machine and allow hot, pressurized water to flow through the coffee.\n
            4. Stop Early: Crucially, stop the extraction much earlier than for a standard espresso. Aim for approximately 15-20ml of liquid in 15-20 seconds for a single shot.\n
            5. Serve: The result is a highly concentrated, full-bodied shot with a rich aroma and often a sweeter taste."
    coffee_type_2:
        name: Espresso
        info: Strong, concentrated coffee brewed under high pressure, with a thick crema.
        preparation: "Espresso is made by forcing hot, pressurized water through finely ground coffee.\n
            \n
            1. Grind: Use freshly roasted coffee beans, ground very finely, similar to powdered sugar.\n
            2. Dose: Measure the appropriate amount of ground coffee into the portafilter (e.g., 7-10g for a single, 14-20g for a double).\n
            3. Tamp: Compress the coffee grounds firmly and evenly into a flat puck using a tamper.\n
            4. Brew: Lock the portafilter into the espresso machine. Activate the pump, forcing hot water (around 90-96°C / 195-205°F) through the coffee at high pressure (around 9 bars).\n
            5. Extract: The shot should pour as a steady, thin stream, resembling warm honey. Aim for about 25-30 seconds to yield 25-35ml for a single shot, or 50-70ml for a double.\n
            6. Serve: The finished espresso should have a distinctive, reddish-brown crema on top. Serve immediately."

        info: An extended espresso, made with more water, resulting in a milder taste.
        ingredients: ['@ingredient_1']
        preparation: "A Lungo (\"long\" in Italian) is an espresso shot extracted with more water, resulting in a larger volume.\n
            \n
            1. Grind: Use a grind setting slightly coarser than for a standard espresso, or the same as espresso depending on desired outcome and machine.\n
            2. Dose & Tamp: Use the same amount of finely ground coffee as for a standard espresso (e.g., 7-10g for a single, 14-20g for a double). Tamp firmly and evenly.\n
            3. Extraction: Initiate the espresso machine, allowing hot, pressurized water to flow through the coffee.\n
            4. Longer Extraction: Allow the extraction to continue for a significantly longer time than a standard espresso, typically aiming for double the volume (e.g., 50-70ml for a \"single\" lungo) over 45-60 seconds.\n
            5. Serve: The resulting lungo will be larger and milder than a standard espresso, often with less intense flavor compounds."

        name: Cafe Crema
        info: A larger espresso with a thick layer of crema and more water.
        ingredients: ['@ingredient_1']
        preparation: "A Caffè Crema is a longer coffee resembling a large espresso with a significant layer of crema, often prepared using an espresso machine.\n
            \n
            1. Grind: Use a coarser grind than for a traditional espresso, but finer than for drip coffee. Some machines have a specific \"Caffè Crema\" setting.\n
            2. Dose & Tamp: Use a standard espresso dose (e.g., 7-10g for a single, 14-20g for a double). Tamp firmly and evenly.\n
            3. Extraction: Initiate the espresso machine, allowing hot, pressurized water to flow through the coffee.\n
            4. Extended Extraction: Allow the extraction to continue for a longer period than a Lungo, aiming for a larger volume (e.g., 120-180ml) over 25-40 seconds, depending on the desired strength and volume.\n
            5. Serve: The result is a coffee with a larger volume and a persistent, thick layer of crema on top."
    coffee_type_5:
        name: Americano
        info: Espresso diluted with hot water to resemble drip coffee.
        ingredients: ['@ingredient_1', '@ingredient_9']
        preparation: "An Americano is made by diluting an espresso with hot water to achieve a similar strength to drip coffee while retaining espresso's flavor.\n
            \n
            1. Heat Water: Heat water to just below boiling, typically around 80-90°C (175-195°F).\n
            2. Brew Espresso: Prepare one or two shots of espresso. This involves grinding beans finely, dosing 7-20g into the portafilter, tamping, and extracting 25-70ml of liquid in 25-30 seconds using an espresso machine.\n
            3. Combine: Pour the hot water into a cup, then add the prepared espresso shots on top. This method helps preserve the espresso's crema. Alternatively, espresso can be added first, then hot water. The ratio of espresso to hot water typically ranges from 1:1 to 1:4, depending on desired strength.\n
            4. Serve: Stir gently and serve immediately."

            6. Enjoy: Serve immediately with a straw."
    coffee_type_7:
        name: Long Black
        info: Espresso shots poured into hot water, similar to an Americano but retaining more crema.
        preparation: "A Long Black is a coffee drink popular in Australia and New Zealand, made by pouring a double shot of espresso over hot water, distinguishing it from an Americano by preserving the crema.\n
            \n
            1. Heat Water: Heat water to a hot, but not boiling, temperature, usually around 80-90°C (175-195°F).\n

        ingredients: ['@ingredient_1', '@ingredient_3', '@ingredient_10']
        preparation: "A Cappuccino is traditionally made with equal parts espresso, hot steamed milk, and a generous layer of milk foam.\n
            \n
            1. Brew Espresso: Prepare a single or double shot of espresso directly into your serving cup (a pre-heated 150-180ml or 5-6 oz cup is ideal). This involves grinding beans finely, dosing 7-20g, tamping, and extracting 25-70ml in 25-30 seconds using an espresso machine.\n
            2. Steam Milk: While the espresso is brewing or immediately after, steam cold milk (about 120-150ml for a single cappuccino) using your espresso machine's steam wand.\n
                - Frothing: Begin by incorporating air into the milk just below the surface to create foam (the \"stretching\" phase), aiming for a roughly 1cm increase in volume.\n
                - Heating: Submerge the wand deeper and continue heating the milk until it reaches about 60-65°C (140-150°F), becoming velvety and smooth (the \"texturing\" phase). The foam should be fine and integrated, not large bubbles.\n
            3. Pour Milk: Swirl the steamed milk in the pitcher to integrate the foam and liquid.\n
            4. Combine: Pour the steamed milk directly over the espresso. Aim for a pour that combines the liquid milk and a generous amount of foam, creating distinct layers or a smooth integration depending on style.\n
            5. Serve: A classic cappuccino has a dome of foam. It can be dusted with cocoa powder if desired. Serve immediately."

            2. Steam Milk: Immediately after brewing the espresso, steam cold milk (about 180-240ml for a standard latte) using your espresso machine's steam wand.\n
                - Frothing: Briefly incorporate air into the milk just below the surface to create a small amount of fine foam (the \"stretching\" phase), aiming for only a slight increase in volume (e.g., 0.5cm).\n
                - Heating: Submerge the wand deeper and continue heating the milk until it reaches about 60-65°C (140-150°F), becoming smooth and velvety (the \"texturing\" phase). The foam should be very fine and fully integrated with the liquid milk.\n
            3. Pour Milk: Swirl the steamed milk in the pitcher to ensure the microfoam is fully incorporated.\n
            4. Combine: Pour the steamed milk directly over the espresso. The goal is a continuous pour that results in a creamy texture with a very thin layer of integrated foam on top. This is where latte art is often created.\n
            5. Serve: Serve immediately, often without additional toppings."
